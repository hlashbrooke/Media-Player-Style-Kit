Change the colors of the WordPress media player right from the Customizer.

== Description ==

The WordPress media player is great and all, but the default styling doesn't fit into too many themes. Couple that with the fact that there aren't a lot of theme developers who add custom styles for the media player and you have the need for this plugin - a simple way to change your media player colors without writing a single line of code.

**Features**

- Easily editable colors in the familiar Customizer interface
- No need to write custom CSS or any other code
- Live previews of color changes inside the Customizer
- Replaces the media player buttons with the WordPress Dashicons font for easy customization
